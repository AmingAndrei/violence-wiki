The *Kingdom Nullifera* encompasses all life forms native to the [[Blackspace]], which exist outside the biological frameworks established in [[Realspace]]. Due to the vast genetic diversity and lack of correlation between species, *Nullifera* functions as a wastebasket taxa, grouping together all known genuses despite their fundamental differences. This dissimilarity is largely attributed to the influence of the [[Imago]]

Though these life forms appear organic, they are entirely composed of [[Blackstone]], mirroring the chemical components of organic matter. Like all [[Blackstone]], species within *Nullifera* are virtually indestructible through [[Realspace]] means.

Known genus in *Nullifera Kingdom*:  
- [[Diavolos]] genus
- [[Maniakos]] genus
- [[Sanguis]] genus
- [[Fae]]
- [[Nanite]]-based entities
