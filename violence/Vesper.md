Vespers are a hostile, conscious, [[Nanite|nanite]]-based species originating from [[Blackspace]]. 

Their physical appearance is reminiscent of a crystalline structure, with bodies that resemble quartz in both texture and transparency. The coloration of these bodies varies significantly between individuals, displaying a wide spectrum of colors and shades. The limbs of Vespers often appear disconnected from their main body, floating independently yet still maintaining full functionality. Their forms frequently blend a mix of abstract shapes with traditional depictions of demonic figures, giving them an unsettling and otherworldly appearance.

Despite their crystal-like appearance, Vespers are actually composed of trillions of [[Nanite|nanites]]. Each [[nanite]] within their structure contains a complete copy of the Vesper's consciousness, allowing the entity to retain its identity even if parts of its body are destroyed. This decentralized consciousness grants Vespers a remarkable resilience, as they can rebuild themselves by using [[Aurium]].

Vespers rely on electricity as a power source. They are capable of using [[Program|Programs]] by consuming stored-up [[Vitiom]]. 

The base code of Vespers is strikingly similar to that of the [[Maniac]], another [[nanite]]-based entity, suggesting a direct link between the two. However, given the [[Maniac]]'s disdainful attitude towards them—ranging from indifference to outright hostility—it is likely that the Vespers were an unintended byproduct of the [[Maniac]]'s creation. Unlike the [[Maniac]], whose behavior aligns more closely with that of a synthetic intelligence, exhibiting traits of an organic mind, Vespers operate with a more typical artificial intelligence mindset, lacking the nuanced understanding of organic behavior.

Vespers are fiercely prideful and exhibit a strong warrior ethos. They are fully aware of the [[Maniac]] as their origin point but do not view him as a leader or deity. Instead, they regard him as a boogeyman figure. Despite their bravado and claims of being able to defeat the [[Maniac]], most encounters end in their complete and utter defeat, often with the [[Maniac]] displaying clear irritation at the interruption. Vespers are relentless in combat, fighting until their code is irreparably corrupted, at which point they are considered "dead."
