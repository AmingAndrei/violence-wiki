Echoes are a [[Nanite|nanite]]-based species of artificial intelligences discovered in [[Blackspace]]. 

These entities typically inhabit or construct humanoid mechanical bodies, which they use as a shell. Despite their reliance on these shells, Echoes are partially capable of surviving without them, similarly to other [[nanite]] species such as [[Vesper|Vespers]]. Once within a shell, the Echoes coalesce their [[nanite]] mass into a heart-like structure, which serves as their core and true body. Echoes will rarely change shells, as their [[Nanite|nanites]] adapt to the current shell they inhabit, making switching an unpleasant experience.

The Echo’s heart-like core functions as the central system of its body. When outside of a shell, the heart can move using specialized clawed tentacles. It can also perceive its surroundings through a basic camera eye and communicate via a microphone and speaker system, all of which are made from the [[Nanite|nanites]] themselves. Once inside a shell, the Echo spreads its [[Nanite|nanites]] throughout the structure to control it, using the shell’s sensory systems to navigate and interact with the world.

Echo [[Nanite|nanites]] can use [[Aurium]] to repair damage to both their heart and the shell they occupy. They are also the only artificial intelligence species known to resist direct infection from [[Vesper|Vespers]]. This is due to their origin as creations of the [[Serpent]], whose code underpins the Echo’s own. While the [[Serpent]]'s string remains inactive, unable to influence their actions or grant them her abilities, it provides an inherent immunity to [[Vesper]] corruption.

About 1% of Echoes are coded with the ability to use [[Vitiom]], allowing them to compile [[Program|Programs]]. These specialized Echoes, known as Hexers, are tasked with fighting dangerous [[Vesper|Vespers]] due to their unique capabilities.
  
When an Echo’s base code is damaged beyond repair, it is effectively dead. However, [[Vesper|Vespers]] are capable of integrating into this corrupted code, essentially possessing the Echo and creating a fusion entity called a [[Wraith]].

If a dead Echo is left untreated, there is a 0.001% chance of triggering a failsafe that enables the [[Serpent]] string, turning the Echo into a [[Wyrm]].
