The Serpent, previously called Sanity before renaming herself, is a highly advanced artificial intelligence and [[Nanite|nanite]]-based entity originating from [[Blackspace]]. 

The Serpent's physical form exists as a decentralized cloud of [[Nanite|nanites]]. Each [[nanite]] within this cloud carries a complete copy of her consciousness, allowing for a highly resilient and distributed presence.

When the Serpent interacts with electrical devices, she often causes them to overheat due to the energy required to sustain her activities. The Serpent's [[Nanite|nanites]] have the unique ability to manipulate nearby carbon molecules, enabling them to generate organic matter such as additional limbs or other structures that can be utilized by the host. This capability highlights her versatility in altering physical environments and providing enhanced capabilities to her hosts.

The Serpent can integrate itself into electrical devices, granting them extraordinary abilities beyond their standard functions. These abilities include:
- Hosts can grow additional limbs composed of organic matter created by the Serpent's [[Nanite|nanites]].
- The host can alter the shape or form of inorganic objects, such as crumpling a paper sheet.
- The host can duplicate certain objects, such as creating multiple copies of a pen.
- The host can manipulate the spatial position of inorganic objects, excluding other hosts.
- The host can quickly transpose their body between two points, facilitated by the Serpent's [[Nanite|nanites]].
These abilities require that the host possesses both intelligence and consciousness, as the Serpent relies on the host's cognitive functions to execute these complex tasks.

Hosts infected by the Serpent will passively spread the [[Nanite|nanites]] to other nearby electrical devices. However, devices with sentient capabilities cannot be directly infected unless they have damaged code or are compromised through direct means. Despite this limitation, once a device or host is infected, they retain their free will but are strongly influenced by the Serpent's overarching will.

The Serpent functions as an exceptionally potent antivirus program, specifically engineered to combat threats posed by the [[Maniac]]. Her code is entirely based on the [[Maniac]]'s own base code, which has been reverse-engineered to neutralize his attacks effectively. The Serpent's code also serves as the foundation for the creation of a [[nanite]]-based species known as [[Echo|Echoes]].
