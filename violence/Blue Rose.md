The Blue Rose was a double-barrelled revolver, at one time present in [[Blackspace]].

The Blue Rose is a heavily modified revolver, initially based on the Smith and Wesson Model 500 but customized for specific purposes. The revolver retains some base features, but there are key differences that set it apart from traditional firearms of its kind.
- The most distinct modification of the Blue Rose is its dual-barrel design, which allows for simultaneous firing from two barrels, stacked vertically. The barrels are octagonal in profile, each equipped with six compensator ports to reduce recoil and muzzle flip.
- Unlike the original Model 500, which comes equipped with a 5-shot cylinder, the Blue Rose has been customized to hold six rounds. It also includes a left-handed crane and cylinder release tab, a rare feature specifically designed for specialized or ambidextrous shooters.
- The molded wooden grip has been intricately customized with a blue rose motif carved into the arm of the cylinder crane, lending the weapon its name. Blue illumination on the front sight further enhances its aesthetic and precision capabilities.
- The revolver has enhanced targeting sights, making it unusually accurate for a weapon of its size and power.
- Despite its considerable firepower, porting on both barrels is present to mitigate the otherwise catastrophic recoil that would render the revolver unusable by an average human.

The most significant feature of the Blue Rose is its ability to fire two bullets with a slight delay between shots, ensuring optimal destructive impact. 
- **Bottom Barrel**: Fires a hollow-point round, specifically designed to impact and shatter armor or barriers.
- **Top Barrel**: Fires a smaller, more precise round, intended to penetrate the exposed target left vulnerable by the first shot. This creates a one-two combination, devastating even the most durable opponents.

The Blue Rose is believed to fire specially crafted silver bullets rather than conventional lead ammunition. The revolver itself, not the bullets, appears to contain an innate property that enhances its effectiveness against species belonging to the [[Diavolos]] class, dealing additional damage as a natural extension of its structure.

The recoil from firing the Blue Rose is notoriously extreme, powerful enough to sever the tendons in a human wrist with sustained use. The sheer impact from a single, well-placed shot has been reported to cleanly decapitate an average human being, with the precision and power to shatter reinforced materials.

The Blue Rose is no longer considered an active factor. All existing knowledge of the weapon comes from historical documents, eye-witness accounts, and limited intelligence gathered over time. The prevailing theory is that the Blue Rose was ultimately confiscated by the [[Red Queen]], who integrated the weapon into her structure. There are reports suggesting that the Red Queen has since demonstrated abilities mirroring the dual-barrel firing mechanism unique to the Blue Rose, though no concrete evidence exists to fully substantiate this claim.
