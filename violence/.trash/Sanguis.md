The *Sanguis* genus, commonly referred to as *Gores*, is classified under the kingdom [[Kingdom Nullifera|Nullifera]], with all known species native to [[Blackspace]]. 

These species are distinguished by their fleshy appearance and biological integration of [[Bloodmetal]], as well as their reliance on [[Realspace]] Blood Moons for various biological processes.

Members of the *Sanguis* genus are characterized by their lack of traditional skin, leaving their blood vessels and musculature fully exposed to the external environment. Their skeletal structure is often partially or entirely visible, with muscles tenuously attached to the bones, giving these creatures a grotesque, blood-soaked appearance. This lack of protective covering contributes to the species' distinctively raw and visceral form.

The most anomalous aspect of the *Sanguis* genus is its method of manifestation. These species require a mass of blood, flesh, or other non-plant organic material to assume form. The source material must originate from a deceased organism, which the species will revitalize even if the organic matter has entered a state of decay. If the mass was not already shifted-[[Blackstone]], it will undergo a conversion process during manifestation. The only methods known to prevent this transformation are the total decomposition of the organic matter or its incineration prior to the process beginning.
