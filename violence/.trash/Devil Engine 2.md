Devil Engines are a species of pseudo-mechanical beings native to [[Blackspace]], belonging to the [[Diavolos]] genus.

Devil Engines possess a distinct resemblance to motorcycles, with their skeletal frames mimicking the structural form of such vehicles. Their bodies exhibit a silver metallic sheen. Their heads resemble equine skulls with a pronounced set of teeth, giving the appearance of a perpetual "smile." The head also functions as an engine, essential for locomotion. They possess two wheel-like structures, located at both ends of the body, serving as their primary means of movement. They have four hollow, twisting horns emerge from the top of the head, resembling handlebars. Devil Engine eyes are large and emit a forward-facing beam of 800 lumens, aiding in navigation and predation.

The cellular biology of Devil Engines enables multifunctionality, allowing their cells to mimic the properties of biological tissues and metals simultaneously. This structural adaptation provides durability, regenerative capabilities, and an inherent metallic appearance. Regenerative abilities allow for the restoration of approximately 5% of total body mass with each engine rev.  
While capable of processing conventional fuels, such as gasoline, optimal performance, including a top speed of 400 km/h, is achieved only when fueled by blood.

Devil Engines are highly mobile predators, relying on their exceptional speed and maneuverability to hunt. They operate in small packs, competing for dominance through racing. Hierarchies are established based on speed and agility. Their brains are optimized for rapid information processing to prevent collisions at high speeds. Dopamine-like chemicals are secreted based on achieved speed, reinforcing their instinctual drive to go faster. While generally cooperative within their packs, Devil Engines exhibit heightened aggression in traffic or when impeded.  

Devil Engines are frequently exploited as vehicles or literal engines, their natural speed and drive being harnessed through technological augmentation. They willingly engage in such roles if provided with enhancements that increase their maximum velocity.

Though Devil Engines share some similarities with [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] in appearance, they are a distinct and unrelated species. The biggest difference is that D​​evil Engines reproduce asexually through mitosis. This process necessitate achieving extreme speeds and consuming significant quantities of fuel.
