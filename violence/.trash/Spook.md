Spooks are a species of [[Maniakos|Spectre]]. 

Spooks reach approximately 60 cm in height. They possess a humanoid body with blue skin. Certain skeletal features, including the joints and spine, protrude through the skin, uncovered by tissue. They lack a lower body, with their torso ending in loose, dangling skin and tissue. The head of a Spook resembles a blend between a humanoid and a reptilian skull, missing both ears and a nose. Their lips are absent, exposing sharp fangs, and their fluorescent green tongue hangs outside their mouths. Spooks have glowing, green eyes that emit light in darkness, matching the color of their tongue.

Spooks lack traditional lower limbs and move by crawling or climbing with their arms. They primarily use their fangs and claws to bite and slash into their prey.
