The Panopticon is the most recognizable landmark of the [[Blackspace]] and is hypothesized to function as its primary defense system.

This structure takes the form of a massive, inverted pyramid composed entirely of [[Blackstone]]. It appears to be suspended in the air, extending indefinitely into the sky. The base of the pyramid, if it exists, remains unobservable, as the Panopticon, like [[Blackspace]] itself, is seemingly endless. The apex of the pyramid is believed to represent the central point of the [[Blackspace]].

Research into the [[Blackspace]] has been constrained to the study of localized overlapping points or materials extracted from the dimension, as the Panopticon serves as an active defense mechanism, detecting and neutralizing any perceived intruders or threats within [[Blackspace]]. The methods by which the Panopticon eliminates these threats are currently unknown; however, all recorded intrusions have resulted in a 100% mortality rate. Any beings or substances introduced into the [[Blackspace]] from [[Realspace]], or any attempts to attack the Panopticon's structure, trigger its security protocols.

The Panopticon is identified as the first intelligent entity encountered within the [[Blackspace]]. During intrusion events, encrypted messages have been intercepted, seemingly encoded as slight radiation emissions within [[Blackspace]] and transmitted in Morse code. Examples of these intercepted transmissions include:

1. "< Intruder/Parasite has breached/infiltrated Blackspace >"
2. "< Normalization Process proceeding >"
3. "< Target neutralized/killed >"
4. "< Nice try >"

These transmissions indicate that the Panopticon is aware of our presence and our attempts to access the [[Blackspace]].
