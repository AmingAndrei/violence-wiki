Razor Trains have been designated as the primary and only approved method for safe transportation to and from the [[Chromatican City]]. This system is integral to maintaining secure and efficient movement of goods and individuals.

The Razor Trains are characterized by a distinct triangular profile. The locomotives are specifically engineered with sharp edges on both the top and front sections. The entire train, including the locomotive and cars, is constructed from a variety of robust metals and alloys, providing durability and structural integrity comparable to that of the [[Citadel]].

Each Razor Train is equipped with approximately 100 cars per journey, designed to maximize load capacity and minimize the frequency of trips. The operational speed of the Razor Trains is maintained at approximately 400 km/h. The trains are engineered to run at low proximity to both the ground and the rails, optimizing stability and performance.

Razor Trains are specifically designed to withstand and navigate the hazardous conditions of the [[Storm]]. The combination of speed, shape, and structural elements enables the trains to pass through these extreme environments with reduced effort and enhanced safety.

Conducting a Razor Train is classified as a high-risk occupation. Due to the extreme conditions and the potential consequences of mechanical failure, which include the loss of cargo and life, conductor roles are compensated at a premium rate.
