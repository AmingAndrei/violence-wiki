The Storm is a vast, sentient weather phenomenon in [[Realspace]], characterized by its enormous dark cloud mass. Within this mass, a blue light is intermittently visible, especially when the clouds part, forming shapes resembling a vertical, jagged mouth or eye.

The Storm is distinguished by its intelligence and extreme temperature fluctuations. Underneath the cloud mass, temperatures plummet to around 0Â° K. The Storm seems to use heat as a primary food source, aggressively targeting the warmest sources within its vicinity.

 
The Storm surrounds the [[Chromatican City]] with a 2 km-wide border, locked in stasis by the heat radiated from the [[Citadel]]. This heat output prevents the Storm from freezing the city, effectively creating a protective barrier. Due to this setup, the only reliable means of entering or exiting the city is via the [[Razor Train|Razor Trains]], which navigate through the Storm's boundary.
