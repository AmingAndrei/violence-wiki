The Yamato is a type of sword, discovered in large quantities in [[Blackspace]].

The Yamato is an uchigatana-class sword, though its length surpasses that of typical uchigatana, approaching that of an ōkatana. However, it is not long enough to be considered a nodachi. The sword's tsukamaki (handle wrapping) follows the traditional diamond pattern of a katana, enhancing grip and structural balance. Beneath the wrapping, a gold dragon-styled menuki is positioned to assist in finger placement during handling. The tsuba (hand guard) is octagonal, with trapezoidal halves that feature gold dot pattern patches and grooves in a motif reminiscent of traditional Japanese designs. Gold rings encircle clusters of circles arranged in triangular patterns. The habaki (blade collar) follows a similar gold-embossed design. The blade itself displays a hamon pattern resembling the kawazuko chōji, or tadpole head clove flower style, which is commonly found on blades historically crafted by Osafune Nagamitsu. The Yamato's blade also exhibits prominent temper lines, a testament to its exceptional craftsmanship.

The scabbard is black, constructed from lacquered wood, with metallic ornaments adorning the far end. The kurigata (scabbard knob) is also black, and a yellow sageo cord, with blue accents and gold dots, is tied to the scabbard, completing the sword's traditional appearance.

The Yamato is not considered a unique weapon. Numerous instances of Yamato have been discovered throughout [[Blackspace]], with significant distances separating each instance. This proliferation suggests two potential origins: either the Yamato swords were mass-produced by an unidentified entity or collective within [[Blackspace]], using unknown methods, or they are a naturally occurring phenomenon, possibly a result of the [[Blackstone]] shifting into the swords under certain conditions.

Yamato swords are renowned for their unparalleled proficiency in slashing. Upon close inspection, these blades exhibit extreme sharpness, capable of slicing through biological structures such as bone with minimal effort. However, what distinguishes Yamato from other bladed weapons is its ability to cut through space itself, rather than merely the material it strikes.

When an object is cut by a Yamato, the weapon severs the space that binds the object’s pieces together, rather than physically cutting the object. This results in the object appearing undamaged, with no observable separation of its components, even down to the atomic level. Objects cut in this manner remain fully functional, provided the pieces remain in proximity and connected by the space that was severed. For example, a limb severed by a Yamato will retain full functionality and show no external damage, provided it remains attached by the slash wound. Furthermore, such cuts cause no physical pain and are virtually impossible to detect or repair.

A secondary and more significant capability of the Yamato is its potential to manipulate space. This ability extends beyond physical slashing, allowing the sword to create spatial rifts. With two perpendicular slashes, a Yamato can open portals between [[Realspace]] and [[Blackspace]]. These rifts enable near-instantaneous travel between dimensions without the need for conventional methods such as the [[Citadel]] or a [[Monolith]].

First-hand accounts and oral reports indicate that the [[Red Queen]] possesses the ability to create portals between dimensions akin to the Yamato's space-slashing properties. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that the [[Red Queen]] absorbed a Yamato sword into her structure, thereby gaining this ability. It is important to note that this dimensional-cutting feature appears exclusive to the [[Red Queen]], as no other [[Devil Arm]] has demonstrated the capacity to absorb a Yamato and acquire its unique spatial manipulation abilities.
