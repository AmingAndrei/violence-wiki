Mirages are a species of [[Maniakos|Spectre]]. 

Mirages stand around 60 cm tall when upright. They possess both an exoskeleton and an endoskeleton, both exhibiting a blue coloration. Their bodies are short and chubby, with visible spine and ribcage structures exposed through their skin. Their front limbs are equipped with large, pincer-like appendages, resembling the claws of a bulldozer more than any known crustacean. Their small, but highly developed hind legs are adapted for swift and precise swimming. Their head is a combination of humanoid and angler fish traits, with a prominent row of visible fangs. A green, glowing angler protrudes from their forehead, while their eyes emit a matching glow.

Mirages are aquatic predators, using their powerful fangs and pincers to attack and dismember prey that enters their waters. While Mirages possess a glowing angler similar to that of an angler fish, this feature appears to serve no functional role in their hunting process and is purely aesthetic.

Mirages are a formidable aquatic species within the *[[Maniakos]]* genus, utilizing speed and strength in water to capture and dismantle their prey. Their distinctive angler feature, while visually striking, offers no apparent advantage in their predatory behavior.
