The Proxis System is an outdated yet operational protocol enabling access to the [[Blackspace]] in a manner that remains undetected by the [[Panopticon]].

The Proxis System operates under two fundamental principles:
- Objects comprised of [[Blackspace]] matter bypass [[Panopticon]] security protocols. This exemption applies universally to objects, whether created within [[Blackspace]] or produced in [[Realspace]] using materials sourced from [[Blackspace]].
- Material exiting [[Blackspace]] retains a virtual association with it, effectively projecting its presence into [[Realspace]] while remaining within [[Blackspace]] parameters. Consequently, such material remains imperceptible and intangible within the [[Blackspace]] if they are projected into [[Realspace]]. This principle allows [[Blackspace]] entities to reincorporate into [[Blackspace]] postmortem. Upon destruction in [[Realspace]], an entity will reform within [[Blackspace]]; final termination can only be achieved through elimination within the [[Blackspace]] itself.

The Proxis System reverses this process, allowing human operatives to engage with the [[Blackspace]] indirectly. The System’s mainframe is a large, red pyramid structure analogous to a quantum supercomputer. Contact with this mainframe will physically absorb the subject and transport their consciousness into a body within the [[Blackspace]]. In the event of bodily death within the [[Blackspace]], the Proxis System forcibly ejects the subject’s consciousness, returning it to [[Realspace ]] with immediate expulsion from the mainframe.

Upon activation, the System fabricates a slightly emaciated humanoid body optimized for [[Blackspace]] navigation. This body exhibits notable deviations from typical human physiology, such as the construct being entirely hairless, lacking an oral cavity, and featuring an exoskeleton-like dermal layer providing structural defense. ​The digestive tract is non-existent. Vital organs remain exposed to the atmosphere but are shielded by a specialized exoskeleton. The body is formed within a cyst-like rock chamber, created within [[Blackstone]], from which it emerges upon full formation.

The Proxis System is specifically calibrated for human DNA. Attempts to transport non-human species result in severe physiological distortions, with the System unable to adequately interpret and reconfigure non-human genetic material.

In critical situations, the Proxis System can generate auxiliary "dummy agents." These agents are featureless humanoid constructs composed of [[Bloodmetal]] and lack cognitive autonomy. Instead, they operate according to a predetermined, limited parameter set established upon creation. The number of dummy agents deployable at any given time is inversely related to the complexity of the programmed parameters; as task complexity increases, the allowable number of agents decreases. Dummy agents are notably fragile, with their form shattering upon direct impact. Any level of shattering will immediately disable and terminate the agent.
