Ningen represent a distinct, retroactively identified species of [[Eukarya|re-evolved]] humans within [[Blackspace]]. Adapted for both terrestrial and aquatic environments, Ningen demonstrate advanced physiological evolution compared to Homo sapiens, with unique life stages and anatomical adaptations suited for extreme arctic and oceanic conditions.

Ningen exhibit a three-stage lifecycle, characterized by significant morphological and habitat adaptation at each stage:

As juveniles, Ningen resemble bipedal, hairless sea mammals with an overall cetacean-like appearance, thick blubber for insulation, and developed hand-like feet. Physical characteristics include:
- Large human-like skulls with two legs attached for mobility.
- Absence of nasal cavities, black eyes adapted to low temperatures.
- Unique skeletal structure featuring a short spine, a small ribcage, and appendicular formations aiding in mobility.
- Height approximately 1.8 meters.

Transitioning into full aquatic adaptation during adulthood, Ningen lose their terrestrial capabilities and grow to approximately 16 meters. This form is optimized for underwater survival, with transformations including:
- Replacement of hand-feet structures with functional humanoid arms.
- Extension of the spine into a whale-like tail.
- Expanded ribcage and flipper-like appendages.
- Retention of the human-like skull structure, elongated jaws, and air-breathing capability, though surface breathing is infrequent.

In the final life stage, the Ningenâ€™s body sheds entirely, leaving only the central nervous system, particularly the spine. This remaining structure propels the Ningen through water and air independently. Utilizing peripheral nerves, it perceives its environment and conducts hunting operations.

Ningen reproduce asexually. In full maturity, individuals seek specific structures or formations within their environment to merge with, integrating their biomass into these structures. This process yields multiple juvenile Ningen, emerging as humanoid, skinless masses that undergo further development.

Ningen are highly intelligent hunters with acute visual perception and the ability to detect fear in prey. They possess strong jaws capable of severing bone and tissue, with an enhanced instinctual drive and superior memory capacity. Their skeletal composition includes bullet-resistant bone. Ningen possess an exceptional grip strength, potentially lethal to humans, and are noted for their speed and agility across diverse environments. While Ningen display a preference for consuming human species, this is not a biological requirement, indicating cannibalism is likely a cultural preference.
