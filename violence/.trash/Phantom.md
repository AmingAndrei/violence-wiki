Phantoms, a species of [[Maniakos|Spectre]]. 

Phantoms are approximately 100 cm in length. They possess blue skin with prominent skeletal protrusions, most notably along the spine and wing bones. Their upper limbs consist of torn, membranous wings. Phantoms lack traditional lower limbs. Their body tapers into a crude tail formed by their exposed spine, with the torso narrowing around it. Their eyes are fluorescent and glow green.

Phantoms are capable of flight, reaching speeds of up to 60 km/h. They use their agility in the air to their advantage, often swooping down to attack prey swiftly before retreating. Phantoms typically disorient their targets by flying at high speed before initiating a quick strike. Their ability to attack from the air makes them elusive and difficult to counter.
