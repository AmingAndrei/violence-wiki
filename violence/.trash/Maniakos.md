The *Maniakos* genus, commonly referred to as *Spectres*, was accidentally discovered within [[Blackspace]], classified in the kingdom [[Kingdom Nullifera|Nullifera]]. These entities exhibit biologically impossible adaptations unique to [[Blackspace]]. 

Spectres are entirely intangible, unable to physically interact with or leave any trace in the physical world. They cannot be seen or engaged by conventional means, making their presence undetectable. Spectres were identified only after multiple patients suffering from severe schizophrenic episodes reported consistent visual experiences. These patients were later found dead, exhibiting wounds that could not be attributed to any known entity, either from [[Realspace]] or [[Blackspace]].

Spectres are only visible to individuals with significantly diminished mental stability, commonly referred to as "insane." Those of sound mind are neither perceived by nor able to perceive Spectres. Spectres actively target individuals with compromised mental soundness. The means by which they sustain themselves, reproduce, or evolve to possess this selective perception remain unknown.

Spectres are thought to exist in high concentrations in densely populated areas. They are immune to harm by conventional methods; only objects wielded by mentally compromised individuals appear to affect them.
