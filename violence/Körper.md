Körper type [[Devil Trigger|Devil Triggers]] are a specific manifestation of [[Devil Trigger]] phenomena, characterized by the generation of additional mass around the user's entire body. 

- The generated mass can take various forms, ranging from something akin to a suit of armor that closely fits the user's body to an enormous, body-encompassing structure far larger than the user themselves.
- Despite the potentially vast size of the Körper manifestation, the user's actual physical body is always located near the nape area of the newly formed mass.
