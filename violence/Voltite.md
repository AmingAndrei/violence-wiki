Voltite is an anomalous material found exclusively within [[Blackspace]]. It appears as a pale yellowish metal with a high degree of flexibility and a melting point of approximately 1200Â°C. Voltite is notably lightweight, making it versatile for use in various structures and mechanical applications.

Voltite's most remarkable property is its ability to conduct electricity at levels ten times greater than traditional conductive metals such as gold or copper. This makes it an exceptional conductor. Despite its superior electrical conductivity, Voltite acts as a poor conductor of heat, effectively insulating against temperature transfer. This anomalous behavior allows Voltite to maintain stability in environments where high electrical currents are present without suffering from overheating.
