Devil Strands, classified under the [[Diavolos]] class, represent a species of strand-like organisms originating from [[Blackspace]].

Devil Strands are multicellular microorganisms, with a body structure that grows in resilient, thread-like strands, radiating a bright red light. These strands exhibit durability surpassing standard materials used in [[Realspace]] textiles. Furthermore, Devil Strands possess notable regenerative capabilities; in some instances, they can fully restore after a complete severing, provided they have access to enough blood to facilitate this process.

Functioning as parasitic organisms, Devil Strands derive sustenance from the resources within host nervous and circulatory systems. To prolong host viability, they establish connections with the peripheral nervous system, avoiding intrusion into vital internal organs. Observations indicate a degree of sentience in Devil Strands, with evidence suggesting decision-making capabilities and basic adaptive responses to environmental stimuli, more specifically genetic and physiological adaptations.

Devil Strands are utilized extensively in textile manufacturing, ranging from casual attire to specialized uniforms. Standard garments incorporate a minimal percentage of Devil Strand material, with the proportion directly impacting garment resilience. Clothing composed entirely of Devil Strands demonstrates extreme durability, strength, flexibility and adaptive capabilities; however, it imposes extreme physical strain on the wearer, complicating practical use and requiring specialized handling.

Every Devil Strand garment incorporates an essential core thread that reinforces and maintains structural cohesion. This primary thread is safeguarded by multiple protective layers of Devil Strands, rendering it difficult to locate or sever. Disruption or removal of this core thread results in garment disintegration. All Devil Strand textiles are constructed to include at least one such core thread.

In rare occurrences, Devil Strands have exhibited the capacity to self-organize into humanoid clothing formations, capable of autonomous movement and, in some cases, rudimentary communication via a self-constructed lung and vocal cord system. These self-animating forms can be identified by their unified, single-garment construction, absence of a head structure, and the presence of loose strands emanating from the neck opening.
