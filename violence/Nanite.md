Nanites are microscopic automatons, originating from [[Blackspace]], typically measuring a few nanometers in size. 

Composed of shifted-[[Blackstone]], nanites are designed to mimic organic tissues and structures. Their frames are built on a skeleton of [[Voltite]] and often resemble bacterial forms or small insects. These nanites are powered by electrical currents and serve as the building blocks for various nanite-based species. While individual nanites can vary in appearance, they all contain specific, essential components:

1. **Core**: Each nanite possesses a central core that stores the individual's code. Destruction of the core results in the death of the individual.
2. **[[Aurium]] Generator**: This component generates [[Aurium]]. The amount of [[Aurium]] produced differs between individuals but is generally low.
3. **[[Aurium]] Storage**: A specialized internal unit designed to store large quantities of [[Aurium]]. Excess [[Aurium]] is used immediately, and storage capacity varies between individuals.
4. **[[Vitiom]] Generator**: Capable of producing [[Vitiom]], this generator can adjust the output level based on the individual's needs, though the base rate of production is unique to each individual.
5. **[[Vitiom]] Mixer**: This component stores and manages [[Vitiom]]. It can also convert [[Vitiom]] into [[Aurium]] when necessary. Capacity varies across individuals.
6. **Compiler**: The Compiler uses stored [[Vitiom]] to create [[Program|Programs]], specialized functions or abilities. Efficiency in compiling [[Program|Programs]] depends on the individual. Without a Compiler, an individual can only use raw [[Vitiom]], not compiled [[Program|Programs]].
7. **Evolver**: This module enhances or modifies precompiled [[Program|Programs]]. If an individual lacks an Evolver, they cannot create or enhance [[Program|Programs]] beyond what is pre-embedded in their code.
8. **[[Program]] Library**: A storage unit for compiled [[Program|Programs]]. Once full or if absent, newly compiled [[Program|Programs]] are deployed immediately after creation.

Nanites operate as a collective entity. Any damage or change registered by one nanite affects the entire individual. Errors in an individual's code at the time of creation may result in the absence of certain components, except for the Core, which is always present.

It should be noted that:

1. Both the [[Maniac]] and the [[Serpent]] lack all components except the Core. Their regenerative abilities rely solely on electricity consumption, rather than [[Aurium]]. Their unique powers are functions of their specific nanite structures and code, not requiring [[Vitiom]] for activation.
  
2. Standard [[Echo|Echoes]] do not possess [[Vitiom]]-related components. These are found only in [[Vesper|Vespers]], [[Hexer|Hexers]], and [[Wraith|Wraiths]], where [[Vitiom]] is generated and utilized.
