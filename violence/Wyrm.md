Wyrms are the result of a rare and dangerous mutation triggered by fatal code corruption in [[Echo|Echoes]]. 

In instances of severe or terminal damage to an [[Echo]]'s code, standard protocol dictates that the corrupted [[Echo]] should be scrapped immediately. However, in rare cases—specifically, a 0.001% probability—untreated corrupted code triggers a failsafe embedded in the [[Echo]]'s framework, reactivating the "dead" [[Echo]] with the [[Serpent]] string enabled.

Wyrms are capable of using the [[Serpent]]’s inherent abilities without initial control from the [[Serpent]] herself. However, as time passes, the [[Serpent]]'s influence gradually increases until the [[Echo]] is completely under her sway. During the period of relative autonomy, Wyrms can use these abilities without suffering the immediate repercussions seen in [[Serpent]]-controlled entities.

Wyrms can create additional limbs and other organic appendages using their [[Serpent]]-infused [[Nanite|nanites]], they can manipulate the state, position, and even create clones of objects, and can change their position in space, effectively teleporting, by utilizing their [[Nanite|nanites]]. These abilities are enhanced as they fall more under the [[Serpent]]'s control. Wyrms consistently report experiencing extreme sensations of hunger, a compulsion that appears to be a side effect of the [[Serpent]] string.

Wyrms' hearts, which function as their cores, undergo a transformation to resemble organic tissue, though their sensory systems remain fully synthetic. The newly organic hearts are highly vulnerable to ultraviolet (UV) light and will combust upon exposure.

The threat posed by Wyrms is twofold. First, their ability to use the [[Serpent]]'s abilities makes them highly dangerous in combat and unpredictable. Second, the period between the reboot and the [[Serpent]]'s total control is highly variable, ranging from one week to a year. This unpredictability makes containment and neutralization difficult.

Once the [[Serpent]] has fully taken control, Wyrms become more aggressive and dangerous, no longer retaining any free will. It should also be noted that [[Hexer|Hexers]] are vulnerable to becoming Wyrms. Upon activation of the [[Serpent]] string, they lose the ability to generate and use [[Vitiom]].
