Hume normalisation refers to the process through which objects, beings, or matter with differing Hume levels undergo modification to align with the environmental Hume level.

A Hume is the standard unit for measuring the degree of "reality" an object or being possesses. The term is derived from philosopher David Hume. The baseline Hume level is 1, the same as the [[Realspace]] Hume level, while [[Blackspace]] is defined as having a Hume level of 0, representing the theoretical absence of reality.

Hume normalization occurs when an object or entity with a non-matching Hume level enters a new environment with a differing Hume baseline. The process involves an adjustment of the object's Hume level to match that of the environment.  

When a high-Hume object or being (e.g., 1 Hume in [[Realspace]]) enters a lower Hume environment (e.g., 0 Hume in [[Realspace]]), it undergoes structural and existential disintegration. The severity of this breakdown is directly proportional to the Hume level disparity. Gradual lowering of Hume levels does not mitigate this effect. The destructive nature is inherent to the normalization process.  

Low-Hume entities or matter (e.g., 0 Hume in [[Blackspace]]) entering a higher Hume environment (e.g., 1 Hume in [[Realspace]]) do not experience any adverse effects. Upon re-entry into a low-Hume environment after normalization to a high-Hume environment, no detrimental effects are observed.

Entities originating in [[Realspace]] (1 Hume) entering [[Blackspace]] (0 Hume) begin to disintegrate shortly after exposure, illustrating the lethal nature of downward Hume normalization. Entities originating in [[Blackspace]] (0 Hume) entering [[Realspace]] (1 Hume), however, experience no discernible changes. The process is non-lethal, and normalized entities maintain stability even after reintroduction to Blackspace.
