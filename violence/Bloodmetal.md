Bloodmetal is a crystalline-metal material indigenous to [[Blackspace]], characterized by its varying shades of red, which contribute to its nomenclature.

Analytical studies have confirmed that Bloodmetal is composed of human blood, including DNA of human origin. However, the DNA profiles correspond to unknown or non-existent individuals. The prevailing hypothesis suggests that Bloodmetal is formed through the process of [[Blackstone]] shifting, though the exact mechanisms remain under investigation.
