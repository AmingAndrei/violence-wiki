Doppelt type [[Devil Trigger|Devil Triggers]] are a specialized manifestation in which the user generates a secondary, fully autonomous body. This secondary entity, though independent, remains influenced by and connected to the user's consciousness.

- The Doppelt Trigger creates a distinct, separate body that is fully disconnected from the user’s physical form.
- This secondary body displays intelligence and can operate autonomously, but it remains heavily influenced or directly controlled by the user through currently unknown mechanisms.
- The secondary body has a limited operational range, beyond which it will automatically deactivate. This range can vary significantly depending on the user.
- The secondary body often takes a vaguely humanoid shape, with sizes ranging from 30 cm to 30 m, with the most common size being between 1.9 to 2 meters.
- Despite its independence, the secondary body is still sustained by the user’s blood, which is required for maintaining activation and for any healing processes. Upon deactivation, the secondary body disintegrates, requiring a new one to be generated with each reactivation of the trigger.
