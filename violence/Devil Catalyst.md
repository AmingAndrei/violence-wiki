Devil Catalysts are an invertebrate-like life form endemic to [[Blackspace]] , belonging to the [[Diavolos]] class. 

These organisms bear a resemblance to [[Realspace]] worms, particularly the hallucigenia, characterized by slightly transparent skin through which their organs emit a faint blue glow. Devil Catalysts typically reach lengths of up to 65 cm. While they are capable of mobility and respiration on dry land, they exhibit a preference for aquatic environments and are often found in water pools within [[Blackspace]]. The species’ most developed organ system is its nervous system, which is one hundred times more complex than that of a human. Despite this advanced neurological structure, Devil Catalysts demonstrate no signs of intelligence beyond that of a typical worm. Additionally, the species exhibits heightened sensitivity to the [[Imago]] and possesses remarkable regenerative capabilities.

A distinguishing feature of Devil Catalysts is their unique form of symbiotic parasitism. These organisms actively seek out the spinal cord of any vertebrate, excluding members of the [[Nullifera|Nullifera]] domain, within their vicinity. Upon making direct contact with the host's spine, the catalyst releases a substantial amount of energy while integrating itself into the spinal cord. This process starts and concludes very rapidly and appears to be painless for the host.

Once parasitized, hosts are physically indistinguishable from unaffected individuals, except for the presence of the catalyst’s nerves, which extend and intertwine with the host’s entire nervous system. Removal of the parasite is impossible due to its fusion with the spine, and any offspring conceived post-infection are born with an embedded Catalyst. Notably, hosts do not exhibit the [[Blackstone]]-related indestructibility, with the exception of their spine.

The term "Devil Catalysts" derives from the process known as [[Devil Trigger]], which hosts are capable of undergoing.
