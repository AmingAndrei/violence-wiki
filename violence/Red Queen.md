The Red Queen is classified as a [[Devil Arm]] and is recognized as the progenitor of the entire species.

In her default state, the Red Queen takes the form of an oversized, single-edged curved sword, primarily composed of a silver-like substance. This form includes a series of propellant mechanisms and an engine situated near the guard. The grip features an integrated revving system similar to that of a motorcycle, along with an additional lever designed to control the power output of the propellants.

In her secondary state, the Red Queen assumes the appearance of a young woman standing approximately 180 cm tall, with her entire body composed of the same silver-like material. The propellant systems that were part of her sword form are now integrated into her back, and every extremity and body part is bladed, granting her the capability to cut through even [[Blackstone]] with her bare hands.

Analysis of damaged and discarded components has confirmed that the Red Queen is not only the first and oldest of the [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] but also their progenitor and the sovereign of their society. Investigations involving other [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] have uncovered deeply rooted emotions of fear and terror associated with the Red Queen. Many are so intimidated that they refuse to even acknowledge her existence, often displaying severe panic and anxiety attacks when questioned. Due to the high probability of adverse outcomes, no attempts to directly interact with the Red Queen herself have been undertaken. The only [[Devil Arm]] who is said to not only not be scared of her, but also to have fought her and survived is [[Wyverian Ignis]].

The Red Queen has been observed interacting frequently with two other entities: [[Alex Atramentum]] and the [[Maniac]].
