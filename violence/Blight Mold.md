Blight Mold is a fungal microorganism, belonging to the [[Maniakos]] genus.

Blight Mold originates as brown, spore-producing growths. When mature, the mold aggregates into a mass resembling humanoid skulls. These formations release spores through the cavities, dispersing them until they land on a flower host. The Mold’s initial form is harmless but serves as the beginning of its life cycle.

Once Blight Mold spores infect a flower, they rapidly integrate with the plant's cellular structure, resulting in a transformed organism known as a Corpsebloom. The Mold overtakes the flower, leading to an appearance of death and decay, though the plant remains fully alive. To most observers, particularly "sane" individuals, a Corpsebloom appears to be continuously wilting, rotting into nothing, although its structure remains intact and functional at the cellular level, albeit invisible, as the infected plant enters a stable form of life, perpetually appearing dead, displaying the same perceptive filtering as other [[Maniakos]] species.

Corpseblooms deviate from traditional plants in their mode of sustenance. They do not rely on photosynthesis but rather a predatory process that targets [[Maniakos|Spectres]]. The plant’s thorny roots act as a trap, actively sensing and attacking nearby [[Maniakos|Spectres]], piercing and draining them of their life force. This ability is unique in that the Corpsebloom can sense [[Maniakos|Spectres]] within a certain radius but remains indifferent to all other entities in its vicinity.

For successful reproduction and continued survival, Corpseblooms rely on a specialised insect species, called a [[Zombee]]. These insects aid in the pollination of the infected plants, helping them spread spores and also providing additional nutrition to the Corpsebloom.
