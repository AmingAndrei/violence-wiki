Devil Trigger is a pseudo-metamorphic biological process that can be initiated by all hosts infected with a [[Devil Catalyst]].

The process is triggered when a specific neural sequence is transmitted through the host's spine, causing the [[Devil Catalyst]] to "activate." During an active Trigger, the host's blood undergoes a color change, ranging from green to blue, and the host gains the ability to constantly regenerate from any damage. The Trigger's activity is fueled by the host's blood, meaning that the Trigger will deactivate automatically when the host's blood levels become critically low. However, this depletion can be mitigated by the host consuming blood, which replenishes their blood supply and prolongs the Trigger.

In addition to enhanced regeneration, the [[Devil Catalyst]] generates additional mass from its extended nervous system. This mass can take various forms, some of which may appear entirely mechanical, yet remain organic in nature. The generated mass is composed of shifted [[Blackstone]], rendering it invulnerable to any damage that is not inflicted by other [[Blackstone]]-derived materials, and will disintegrate once the Trigger has deactivated.

Devil Triggers can be categorized based on their manifestation:

- [[KÃ¶rper]]
- [[Waffe]]
- [[Doppelt]]
