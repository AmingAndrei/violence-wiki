The *Eukarya* domain includes all organisms composed of complex cells, encompassing the majority of multicellular life forms in [[Realspace]]. While primarily associated with [[Realspace]], anomalous adaptations have allowed *Eukarya* species to manifest and thrive within the hostile environments of [[Blackspace]], a domain predominantly governed by the [[Nullifera]] domain.

Species within the *Eukarya* domain that exist in [[Blackspace]] are commonly referred to as "re-evolved." These beings, though entirely adapted to [[Blackspace]] conditions, exhibit genetic ties to [[Realspace]] ancestors. Genetic analysis confirms that re-evolved species remain part of the broader phylogenetic trees of their [[Realspace]] counterparts. Re-evolved species display drastic and often inexplicable adaptations, with the [[Imago]] being frequently cited as a significant factor in these evolutionary shifts, resulting in physiological and behavioral traits that would be otherwise impossible under natural conditions.

Documented examples of re-evolved species include:  
- [[Collosal Salamander|Collosal Salamanders]]
- [[Drakonic Apatelode]]
