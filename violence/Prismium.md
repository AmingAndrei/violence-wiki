Prismium is a light-refracting crystal indigenous to the Astral [[Blackspace]].

This crystal is black, reflects light, and develops in angular, geometric shapes and patterns, with its interiors and extremities exhibiting pale shades of white.

Upon direct exposure to photon particles, Prismium transitions to bright shades of yellow. Within the crystal, light undergoes hyper-reflection and amplification, resulting in the formation of a hyper-focused solid light mass or laser, emitting approximately 130,000 localized lumens. Despite this intense light emission, only 5% of the total lumens illuminate the surrounding area, and the mass or laser can be observed with the naked eye without causing any aftereffects. However, physical contact is strongly discouraged, as contact causes immediate melting of any material in direct contact, despite the absence of detectable heat emission.
