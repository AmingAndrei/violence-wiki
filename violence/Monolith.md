Monoliths are metaphysical constructs intrinsically linked to [[Blackspace]]. These structures serve as conduits between [[Blackspace]] and [[Realspace]], demonstrating significant dimensional and physical anomalies.  

Monoliths manifest as colossal, rectangular quadrilaterals of immense length, composed entirely of [[Blackstone]]. The surface of each Monolith is uniformly smooth and devoid of any observable imperfections. The bottom of a Monolith is not reachable through conventional Euclidean geometry, as it exists partially or entirely within [[Blackspace]]. Monoliths are deeply embedded into the earth, with their bases anchored beyond measurable depths. The general area near a Monolith inhibits plant matter growth within the surrounding area and suppresses microbial activity in proximity to the structure due to low levels of [[Hume Normalisation]].

The level of dimensional overlap between [[Blackspace]] and [[Blackspace]] intensifies in the vicinity of a Monolith, creating localized distortions.

Monoliths function as active conduits between [[Blackspace]] and [[Realspace]]. Direct physical contact with a Monolith's surface can instantaneously transport objects or beings across the dimensional threshold.
