Programs are specialized abilities used by [[Nanite|nanites]] capable of compiling them. These abilities are pieces of code that alter how [[Nanite|nanites]] operate, enabling them to trigger powers such as generating crystalline projectiles or forming energy barriers.  

Programs are created in a *Compiler* module, where they are coded and compiled using [[Vitiom]]. Once compiled, Programs are stored in the *Program Library* for future deployment. These Programs can also be enhanced using additional [[Vitiom]] via the *Evolver* module.

**Program Types**:
- **Integrated Programs**:  
   - Unique to each individual.  
   - Coded into the [[nanite]] structure during creation.  
   - Powerful, specialized abilities.
- **Modular Programs**:  
   - General-purpose and can be learned by most individuals.  
   - Less powerful than Integrated Programs, but versatile.

Programs primarily target the code of opponents or protect the userâ€™s code, though they can also cause physical damage. All Programs require [[Vitiom]] for compilation, limiting their usage to [[Vesper|Vespers]], [[Hexer|Hexers]], and [[Wraith|Wraiths]], capable of producing [[Vitiom]].
