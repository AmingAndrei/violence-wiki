Lumen (Ⱡ) serves as the primary currency system utilized by entities within [[Blackspace]] and the [[Chromatican City]]. The Lumen currency system is structured exclusively as a coin-based economy, with denominations escalating on a base of six.

Each Lumen coin is hexagonal, composed of six detachable triangular clips. These clips interlock to form the full hexagonal shape, and each denomination varies by material and size. This design facilitates easy assembly without compromising the visual depictions on the coin faces, as detailed below.

The Lumen currency system comprises four primary denominations:
- The first coin is constructed from [[Bloodmetal]], and is the smallest in size and value. With no imagery, it holds a total worth of **6** Ⱡ, making each clip equivalent to **1** Ⱡ.
- The second coin is fabricated from [[Moonstone]], and features a crescent moon engraving, visible only when fully assembled. It has a value of **36** Ⱡ, with each clip representing **6** Ⱡ. 
- The third coin is made from [[Sunstone]], and is engraved with a sun and holds a value of **216** Ⱡ. Each clip thus equates to **36** Ⱡ. 
- The fourth coin is the largest denomination, and is crafted from a [[Sunstone]] outer rim and a [[Moonstone]] core, depicting a crescent moon superimposed on a sun, only when fully assembled. This coin has a total worth of **1296** Ⱡ, with each clip valued at **216** Ⱡ.
