Fael Fire is a unique substance produced and wielded exclusively by the [[Paramythi]] class. It functions as both an offensive and defensive tool and exhibits characteristics akin to a blend of kerosene and napalm.

Fael Fire is entirely harmless to [[Paramythi]] beings, posing no risk even during close-contact usage. For non-[[Paramythi]] beings, however, Fael Fire is highly toxic and induces severe burns upon contact, regardless of color. It is capable of sustained combustion even in aquatic environments, similar to Greek Fire.

A distinctive attribute of Fael Fire is its capability to temporarily breach the [[Imago]], creating gaps within it. These gaps are self-sealing over time, indicating that Fael Fire can momentarily disrupt this otherwise stable field.
