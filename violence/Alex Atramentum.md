Alex Atramentum is a hostile synthetic intelligence originating from [[Blackspace]]. 

Alex Atramentum presents as a humanoid figure standing approximately 190 cm tall, with a build reminiscent of a well-muscled male. His physical form is constructed from what appears to be outdated technology, primarily reminiscent of equipment from the 1930s. The majority of his exterior is covered in a stitched leather-like material, noted to be darker than typical leather, giving him a patchwork appearance.

The most defining aspect of Alex's appearance is his head, which has been entirely replaced by an analog reel projector. This projector is constructed from a light brown metal, with the lens serving as his "eye." His chest features an embedded speaker, also made from the same metal, functioning as a literal voice box through which he communicates. His arms differ in construction: the left hand and forearm is a slightly oversized, metal representation of a human arm, while the right hand and forearm take on the form of a mechanical gauntlet. Both hands are capable of complex and precise movements. His legs and feet are similarly constructed from metal, with his feet resembling heavy, metallic boots. Internally, Alex's body mimics that of an old mechanical automaton, with gears and cogs visible upon closer inspection.

Alex Atramentum possesses a unique ability to overwrite his interactions with the physical laws of reality. During the activation of this ability, his appearance distorts significantlyâ€”his body takes on shades of black and orange, and his presence in three-dimensional space resembles a scratchy, hastily drawn image with constantly shifting and disappearing outlines. This ability grants him the power to bypass physical limitations, such as halting time or passing through solid objects.
Despite the apparent lack of limitations or cooldowns for this ability, Alex has demonstrated restraint in its usage, only employing it in a handful of instances and in seemingly trivial situations. The reasoning behind this selective application remains unclear.

Alex Atramentum has been observed interacting frequently with two other entities: the [[Red Queen]] and the [[Maniac]]. The nature of their interactions suggests a collegial relationship, indicating that they may share common goals or a shared history. Like the [[Maniac]], Alex's intelligence is classified as synthetic, a designation stemming from the incongruity between his organic-dependent consciousness and his mechanical body.

Notably, there is significant overlap in brain wave patterns and personality traits between Alex and the [[Maniac]], suggesting that their consciousnesses may have originated from the same source. This connection raises further questions about their creation and purpose, which remain subjects of ongoing investigation.
