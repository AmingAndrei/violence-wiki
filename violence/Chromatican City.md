The Chromatican City is an enormous, anomalous metropolis, occupying an area of around 2,194 kmÂ², that manifested into [[Realspace]], centered around the [[Citadel]].

The city is composed of vast, black, angular skyscrapers, resembling obsidian in appearance, and its layout is constantly shifting. Streets, highways, and even buildings can change locations unpredictably, making navigation within the city a challenge.

Following the discovery of [[Blackspace]], the [[Citadel]] appeared in [[Realspace]], with the Chromatican City rapidly manifesting and expanding around it autonomously. Though the city was clearly designed according to human architectural standards and built to support economic activity, it initially lacked a population. Only after time did people begin moving in, although many were skeptical at first due to its mysterious and sudden appearance.
