Vitiom is an actively produced substance by the [[Nanite|nanites]] of [[Vesper|Vespers]], [[Hexer|Hexers]], and [[Wraith|Wraiths]]. It appears as a viscous, dark red liquid, with gas-like properties.

Vitiom is synthesized by [[Nanite|nanites]] capable of using it, with general output varying between individuals. Though its production can be influenced by the individual, it has minimal impact on its overall effectiveness. It is stored in specialized modules known as Vitiom Mixers.

In its pure form, Vitiom can cause code damage in other [[nanite]] beings, although it is primarily used for compiling [[Program|Programs]]. In case of emergency, stored Vitiom can be converted into [[Aurium]].
