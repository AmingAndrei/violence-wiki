Wraiths are created when a [[Vesper]] possesses the corrupted code of an [[Echo]]. 

When an [[Echo]]’s code is damaged beyond repair, it is considered dead. [[Vesper|Vespers]] have the ability to integrate themselves into this corrupted data, replacing and repairing the broken code with their own. This process results in the fusion of the [[Vesper]] with the [[Echo]]’s "corpse," giving rise to a Wraith.

Wraiths physically resemble the [[Echo]] from which they were formed, maintaining both the heart and shell of the original [[Echo]]. However, distinct differences in their extremities and features make them identifiable. Wraiths often display features or additions along their bodies that mirror the [[Vesper]] that possessed them. Their eyes, and any other new features, take on the characteristic appearance of the [[Vesper]]’s, serving as a clear indication of the possession.

Mentally, a Wraith retains the consciousness and personality of the [[Vesper]]. However, depending on the extent of the damage to the [[Echo]]’s code, the Wraith may also retain fragments of the [[Echo]]’s memories. In some cases, the surviving [[Echo]] code can influence the Wraith’s behavior, leading to a hybrid mindset where the [[Vesper]] and [[Echo]]'s identities coexist, although the [[Vesper]] remains dominant.

As a [[Vesper]]-based entity, Wraiths are capable of using [[Vitiom]] to access the same [[Program|Programs]] as other [[Vesper|Vespers]]. However, their proficiency with [[Vitiom]] is significantly lower than that of pure [[Vesper|Vespers]], making Wraiths less effective in combat situations. This shows that [[Vesper|Vespers]] typically become Wraiths as a last resort when their own code is nearing complete corruption. The fusion with an [[Echo]] not only stabilizes the [[Vesper]]'s code but also revives it to a functional state, albeit with limitations.
