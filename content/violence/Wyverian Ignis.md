Wyverian Ignis is a legendary [[Devil Arm]], known for being the only one to challenge the [[Red Queen]] and survive.

In his weapon form, Wyverian takes the shape of a massive, single-edged sword with a rectangular blade. The sword is exceptionally heavy, constructed from a dark, slightly reddish metal. The sword’s handle is equipped with a motorcycle-like throttle mechanism, allowing the wielder to generate power through mechanical means. The top of the blade is fitted with a powerful thruster, accompanied by numerous pipes and mechanical components, adding to the weapon’s unique, engine-like appearance.

In his humanoid form, Wyverian resembles a tall, muscular figure with four arms and four eyes. The two smaller eyes are positioned beneath the primary pair. His face is marked with distinctive lines along its edges, adding to his otherworldly appearance. The thruster from his weapon form is now divided into four smaller thrusters, located on each of his shoulders.

Wyverian Ignis has earned his title as the "King of [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]]" not only for his immense power but also for his fearless defiance of the Red Queen. He is the only known [[Devil Arm]] to have challenged her multiple times and survived.
