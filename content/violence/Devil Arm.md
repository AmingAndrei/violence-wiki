Devil Arms are a sentient, highly intelligent, highly aggressive species of pseudo-mechanical beings discovered within [[Blackspace]], belonging to the [[Diavolos]] class.

Devil Arms possess a mechanical appearance, with bodies resembling steam and diesel engines and their associated components. However, their structure is composed of specialized living tissue, formed from supercells that organize themselves to mimic metallic materials. As a result, despite their metallic and alloy-like appearance, the material constituting Devil Arms is entirely organic and alive. These beings exhibit rapid regenerative capabilities, with approximately 20% of their bodies able to regenerate with each engine rev, a process that releases significant amounts of heat. Their engines are capable of processing standard fuels such as gasoline or oil, but they are optimized to achieve maximum energy intake from blood.

Devil Arms are equipped with sensory abilities that include touch, smell, sound, and taste, but they lack the ability to perceive light and are thus completely blind. They can detect light through tactile sensations but cannot visually interpret it, meaning they have no concept of color. Instead, they rely on a sophisticated system of echolocation, light detection, temperature sensing, and airwave detection, achieving an accuracy rate of 89.6% within a 100-meter range. Their eyes, although capable of movement and reactions similar to those of human eyes, serve no practical function and appear to be purely aesthetic.

Devil Arms exhibit two distinct states. In their default state, they assume the appearance of various mechanical weapons, albeit with more complex designs and functions powered by an internal engine. During this state, they remain fully conscious and aware.

When their engines are fueled by blood, Devil Arms undergo a dramatic transformation, significantly increasing their output. Their mechanical components reconfigure into a humanoid form, with proportions identical to those of a human, including features such as hair, a fully functional human-like face, limbs, and other human characteristics. However, all tissues remain composed of the same metallic material as their default form, with some differences, such as hair resembling chainsaw chains and teeth resembling those of sharks. Devil Arms revert to their default weapon-like state when their fuel supply—blood—is depleted. Devil Arms seem to exhibit sexual dimorphism, although to a lesser extent, similar to humans, are posses the basic concept of gender. Devil Arms reproduction is restricted exclusively to fabrication in the [[Forge]]. 

Devil Arms communicate through a combination of engine revving, low bass roars, mechanical noises, and sounds characteristic of the weapons they resemble in their default state. In their humanoid form, they are capable of verbal communication, though their speech is accompanied by the sound of their engines.

These beings are inherently hostile and extremely aggressive, even in their default weapon-like state, where they display aggressive behavior and make threatening sounds. In their humanoid form, they become highly lethal and efficient killers, driven by both a survival instinct to maintain their transformed state and a seeming desire for entertainment. Like other entities from [[Blackspace]], Devil Arms exhibit the standard [[Blackstone]]-derived indestructibility.

Devil Arms generally fall into a few different weapon types:
- *Switch Axe*: bladed weapon capable of switching between an axe form and a sword form, able to mass release energy
- *Charge Blade*: bladed weapon capable of switching between a sword and shield form, and an axe form, able to deal massive blows
- *Gunlance*: a bladed/ranged mix, consists of a shield and lance, capable of firing close-range shelled ammunition
- *Glaive*: bladed weapon, consist of a double ended polearm, has a storage container for small insects, bacteria, [[Nanite|nanites]], etc, that can be controlled by the Devil Arm
- *Bowgun*: ranged weapon, capable of firing shelled ammunition


The [[Red Queen]] and [[Wyverian Ignis]] are the only sword-type Devil Arms to date, with the Red Queen being capable of utilising all weapon type abilities.
