The domain *Nullifera* encompasses all life forms native to [[Blackspace]], which exist outside the biological frameworks established in [[Realspace]]. Due to the vast genetic diversity and lack of correlation between species, *Nullifera* functions as a wastebasket taxa, grouping together all known classes despite their fundamental differences. This dissimilarity is largely attributed to the influence of the [[Imago]]

Though these life forms appear organic, they are entirely composed of [[Blackstone]], mirroring the chemical components of organic matter. Like all [[Blackstone]], species within the *Nullifera* domain are virtually indestructible through [[Realspace]] means.

Known life forms in the *Nullifera* domain:  
- [[Diavolos]] class
- [[Paramythi]] class
- [[Nanite]]-based entities
