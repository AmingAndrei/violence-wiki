The Imago /ɪˈmäːɡoː/ is a form of radiation-type energy that permeates [[Blackspace]] in its entirety. This energy field cannot be directly interacted with or harvested, but it can be detected and measured. It is uniformly distributed throughout [[Blackspace]]. 

Scientific analyses and approximations have revealed that the Imago contains the complete genetic history of Earth's species. It encompasses the entire genomes of all documented and undocumented species, including individual genetic variations. The Imago is dynamic and continually evolves, capturing every minute DNA change and mutation across all species and individuals over time.
