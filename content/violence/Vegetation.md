Vegetation within [[Blackspace]] constitutes a critical component of the environment, exhibiting similar behavioral and ecological roles to plant life in [[Realspace]]. However, unique characteristics distinguish [[Nullifera]] flora from standard botanical specimens.

While [[Nullifera]] plants demonstrate an apparent capacity for photosynthesis, this process may not the primary energy source of some species. A majority of [[Nullifera]] flora engage in carbon consumption and oxygen production, though this function is not essential for atmospheric viability. The ambient air in [[Blackspace]] is inherently breathable, independent of oxygenation or purification processes.

The flora of [[Blackspace]] includes several unique species, detailed below:

- [[Luxtree]]
- [[Pale Field]]
- [[Sangui Lily]]
