Waffe type [[Devil Trigger|Devil Triggers]] are a variant of [[Devil Trigger]] phenomena that focus on generating mass to modify specific limbs or body parts, rather than the entire body.

- These modifications are localized, using preexisting body parts as the foundation for the transformation.
- The most common areas affected by Waffe type Triggers are the arms and head.
- The rest of the user's body remains unchanged during the activation, maintaining its normal appearance and function.
