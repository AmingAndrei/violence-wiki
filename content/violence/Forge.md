The Forge is a significant landmark within [[Blackspace]], characterized by its immense, metallic structure, designed primarily for the production and repair of [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]].

The Forge presents itself as a vast, industrial complex, with an intricate network of chutes and channels designed to transport and shape liquid metal throughout the facility. The entire structure exhibits signs of severe overheating and galvanization, with constant temperatures registering at approximately 1500Â°C at the primary exit point. The facility appears to be designed with traversal in mind for humanoid entities, though the extreme internal temperatures render direct exploration infeasible. Distant observation, however, suggests the interior functions as a highly stylized, autonomous factory.

The Forge is hypothesized to be the primary origin point, or "birthplace," of all [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] within [[Blackspace]]. The facility operates continuously, producing a new [[Devil Arm]] approximately every few days. Additionally, it serves a secondary function as a repair facility, where [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] with otherwise unhealable injuries are restored.

Though not impervious to [[Blackstone]]-related damage, the Forge exhibits an extraordinary capacity for self-repair. Any inflicted damage results in a noticeable decrease in [[Devil Arm]] production, as resources are redirected to structural repairs. Remarkably, the Forge can reconstruct up to 40% of its total structure within a single day. Due to this rapid rebuilding process, coupled with the protection provided by the [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]], complete destruction of the Forge is currently considered impossible.

The prevailing theory posits that the Forge was constructed by the [[Red Queen]], the progenitor and leader of the [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]] species, to facilitate the ongoing creation and maintenance of her "subjects."
