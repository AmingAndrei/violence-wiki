~~The "M̶i̶n̶o̶t̶a̶u̶r̶" is a creature of unknown origin that occupies the [[Citadel]] and functions, to a degree, as its guardian.~~

~~Its form is characterized by an unnatural fusion of stone and aberrant organic material, shaped in a manner that crudely resembles a bovine figure. This entity exhibits the following features: a pale, armored shell covering its back, resembling a massive hand grasping its throat; its chest is disturbingly adorned with a set of molars clenching vertebrae. Its right shoulder supports a pair of fused arms, used to wield an oversized hammer, while its left side features an elongated, fleshy arm. In addition, grotesque faces, carved in various states of distress, are present just above its hooves. Exposed regions, including joints, much of its underbelly, and its rear, reveal a mass of writhing crimson flesh beneath the exterior.~~

~~The entity frequently traverses the [[Citadel]] in a seemingly aimless manner, though it is the sole being capable of navigating the structure with apparent knowledge and ease. Its extreme hostility to any intruder renders the [[Citadel]] virtually unusable as a reliable means of transit between [[Blackspace]] and [[Realspace]].~~

~~It has been documented that any attempt to reference the entity in digital media—whether by name, codename, pronoun, or otherwise—results in the automatic application of a "strike-through" effect across all text.~~
