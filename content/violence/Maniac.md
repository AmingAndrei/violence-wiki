The Maniac is an exceptionally hostile synthetic intelligence and computer virus originating from [[Blackspace]]. 

The Maniac's physical form consists of a swarm of trillions of [[Nanite|nanites]], each independently capable and containing a complete copy of the Maniac's consciousness. These [[Nanite|nanites]] possess the ability to self-replicate by absorbing electrical currents, making the entity exceedingly difficult to eradicate.

When the [[nanite]] swarm coalesces, it forms the Maniac's true appearance. The Maniac’s limbs, body, and head are disconnected from one another, forming only the head, torso, hands and forearms, and feet up to the knees. This disconnected appearance seems to be a deliberate, stylistic choice.The entire form is composed of an opaque, cyan-navy blue crystal-like substance.

The Maniac’s head resembles classic depictions of demons, with an elongated shape, no visible ears or nose, and eyes that are mere illuminated, slanted spots beneath the crystal surface. The mouth, filled with sharp teeth, can structurally disappear when closed. Two elongated, inward-curving horns resembling those of a goat extend from the back of its head.
The hands and feet are oversized and extremely sharp. The hands are humanoid with large claws, and the forearms extend into spikes. The feet are a hybrid of digitigrade and plantigrade structures, ending in claws and crystal spikes. From the Maniac’s forearms and back extend tentacle-like cables made of [[Nanite|nanites]] but appearing as a metal mix between titanium and aluminum. These cables can merge to form the crystal structure or unravel into additional tools, such as hooks or claws.

The Maniac functions as an advanced computer virus, capable of infecting any electronic device, even those without smart capabilities. The infection process causes extreme physical stress to the device, leading to the formation of blue crystal cysts and spikes, rendering the device inoperable once the host is abandoned. Although capable of infecting multiple devices simultaneously, the Maniac tends to focus on one host at a time, with much of its [[nanite]] swarm residing within it.

 The Maniac can produce a crystalline material identical to its [[nanite]]-composed form. While inanimate, this crystal can interact with the [[Nanite|nanites]] by allowing them to pass freely while acting as a solid barrier to all other entities and materials. This crystal is typically used for defensive walls or offensive projectiles.

Despite its digital and physical nature, the Maniac displays behavior that suggests a synthetic intelligence with disturbingly human-like mental states. This duality led to its classification as a synthetic intelligence.

The Maniac exhibits similarities to another species known as [[Vesper|Vespers]]. Evidence suggests that the Maniac's code serves as the foundation for the [[Vesper|Vespers]]' code. However, any attempts to link the two have been thwarted by the Maniac, who vandalizes records to remove references connecting them. A similar antagonistic relationship can also be observed between the Maniac and the [[Serpent]].

The Maniac has been observed interacting frequently with two other entities: [[Alex Atramentum]] and the [[Red Queen]].
