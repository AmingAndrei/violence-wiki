Blackspace is a dimension superimposed upon [[Realspace]], measured at 0 [[Hume Normalisation|Humes]].

The most reliable method of entry into and exit from Blackspace is through structures called [[Monolith|Monoliths]]. All species native to Blackspace are categorised into the [[Nullifera|Nullifera]] domain.

Blackspace consists entirely of geometric formations and islands composed primarily of [[Blackstone]], suspended within a void, with dunes of red sand forming along these structures. This void, like Blackspace itself, appears infinite across all axes. No identifiable light source has been detected, yet Blackspace is uniformly illuminated with a minimum of 1600 lumens. Notably, specialized instruments have recorded a total light emission of -1 lumens. An anomalous radiation emission, designated as the [[Imago]], can be observed across Blackspace in its entirety.
