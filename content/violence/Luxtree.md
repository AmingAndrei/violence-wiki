The Luxtree is a monumental arbour located at the geographic and symbolic center of [[Blackspace]].  

The Luxtree stands at an approximate height of 1,000 kilometers, with a significant portion of this height attributed to its expansive crown. The crown comprises densely packed, leafless branches. The entire structure exhibits a deep golden-yellow hue, continuously emitting a luminance of 600 lumens from its surface.

The Luxtree coincides with the magnetic north pole, as indicated by magnetic field readings in the region. It serves as a primary navigational landmark within [[Blackspace]]. Its substantial size and inherent self-illumination make it visible from extensive distances, thereby facilitating orientation and travel across the dimension.
