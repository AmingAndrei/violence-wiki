The Fae are an intelligent, humanoid species native to [[Blackspace]].

Fae individuals average approximately 2 meters in height and possess distinct anatomical features that set them apart from humans. They have bluish-gray skin and large eyes. They are quatrodactyls and possess elongated, pointed ears. They have a muscular structure enhanced for strength, indicative of greater physical resilience and present mammalian reproduction patterns.

One of the defining characteristics of the Fae species is their ability to generate and manipulate [[Fael Fire]], a unique substance used for both offensive and defensive purposes. Fae are immune to [[Fael Fire]], allowing them to utilize it without self-harm. While controlling [[Fael Fire]], a Fae’s hair becomes engulfed in flame without damage, serving as a visual marker of their abilities. Their [[Fael Fire]] can range in color from red to blue, with each Fae individual’s flame color being unique.

Fae armor is crafted to provide maximum protection and compatibility with [[Fael Fire]] capabilities. The armour is designed with resilience and flexibility, armor allows fluid movement and minimal vulnerability. Armor colors range from blue to red, with helmets resembling crowns that leave the ears and hair exposed. Specialized gauntlets enable [[Fael Fire]] to be channeled in distinct forms, categorized into ranged and melee functionalities. It is standard for Fae armor to match the user’s [[Fael Fire]] hue for cohesion. 

Ranged gauntlets are asymmetrical, with the dominant hand gauntlet shaped to resemble different animal heads. The dominant hand gauntlet channels [[Fael Fire]] into varied ranged attacks such as flamethrowers, explosive cannon shots, or rapid fire, and so on, depending on the head shape.

Melee gauntlets are symmetrical in appearance, resembling typical gauntlets when inactive. When activated, [[Fael Fire]] manifests as bladed weapons (e.g., swords, spears, axes), rendering the hands temporarily unusable until deactivated.

Fae society is organized into small, city-state entities, with leadership elected democratically on a [[Realspace]] annual basis. Fae are known to avoid unnecessary external interaction, aiming to minimize knowledge of their existence. Violence is employed only as a last resort, with efforts to erase signs of their presence in any given area.
