Sunstones are a type of crystal native to [[Blackspace]]. They are characterized by their yellowish-orange color and naturally form in the shape of a stylized sun, which is the basis for their name.

Sunstones exhibit a reactive property when exposed to a [[Realspace]] solar eclipse, during which they turn black, with only their extremities and edges retaining their original coloration. The significance of this reaction remains unknown at this time.
