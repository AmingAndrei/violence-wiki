Moonstones are a type of crystal native to [[Blackspace]]. They are pale blue in color and naturally form in the shape of a crescent moon, from which they derive their name.

Moonstones exhibit a reactive property when exposed to a [[Realspace]] lunar eclipse, or Blood Moon, during which they turn dark red, with only their extremities and edges retaining their original hue. The significance of this reaction is currently unknown.
