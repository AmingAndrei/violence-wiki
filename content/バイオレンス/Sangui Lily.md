The Sangui Lily is a unique species of flowering plant native to [[Blackspace]].

The plant grows on a singular, predominantly leafless stem. The stem and any present leaves are black in coloration, with a red exodermis. â€‹Each stem supports a single flower. The flower resembles a traditional lily, with alternating red and white petals.

Sangui Lilies possess the rare capability to metabolize blood as their primary source of nourishment. The species does not produce seeds. Sangui Lilies play a critical role in the developmental cycle of a [[Nymph]].
