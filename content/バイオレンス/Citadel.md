The Citadel is a massive metaphysical tower located at the center of the [[Chromatican City]].

The Citadel is around 4km in height. It serves as the largest and most significant transition point between [[Realspace]] and [[Blackspace]]. The external structure is jagged, composed of various metals and alloys.

The Citadel function is similar to a [[Monolith]], a smaller metaspace transition point, but on a much larger scale. It enables passage between [[Realspace]] and [[Blackspace]]. However, due to its unstable and dangerous internal architecture, along with the threat posed by the [[M̶i̶n̶o̶t̶a̶u̶r̶]], travel through the Citadel is less common than through [[Monolith|Monoliths]], which are more convenient for regular use.

The Citadel provides critical protection and stability for the [[Chromatican City]], performing several essential functions, such as generating fields capable of disarming aerial attacks directed toward the Citadel or the City, preventing earthquakes by stabilizing the local tectonic plate.
