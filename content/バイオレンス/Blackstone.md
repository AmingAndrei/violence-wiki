Blackstone is an anomalous, marble-like material indigenous to [[Blackspace]], characterized by its black coloration with gold undertones and its complete resistance to all forms of damage.

This rock-like substance is the predominant material within [[Blackspace]], constituting 80-90% of its total matter. The remaining composition includes Blackstone-based minerals, crystals, and various other substances.

When exposed to direct energy, Blackstone exhibits the ability to alter its molecular structure, rearranging its particles to form any element present on [[Realspace]]'s periodic table or any molecule derivable from them. This includes organic substances such as bone, blood, or neuronal tissue, which have been shown to contain deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and function comparably to their [[Realspace]] equivalents. However, all shifted materials retain Blackstoneâ€™s inherent property of near indestructibility. The mechanism by which Blackstone determines its shifting is currently unknown.

Blackstone is impervious to all forms of damage utilizing [[Realspace]] methodologies. Both Blackstone and its derivatives can only be damaged by other Blackstone-derived objects.

When a shifted Blackstone material sustains significant damage, it partially reverts to its original form before disintegrating into a fine, red dust. This dust is impossible to contain, as each particle rapidly disintegrates without releasing energy. Once initiated, this process is irreversible. However, it can be delayed by supplying the material with direct energy, enabling it to 'repair' itself and regenerate its previous form without any indication of prior damage.
