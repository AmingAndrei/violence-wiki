RMIX is an continuously evolving Unix-based artificial intelligence system, engineered with a neural network framework and optic processing capabilities. Its primary functions encompass the deployment, management, and maintenance of a specialized machine force tasked with defense, surveillance, and exploration within [[Blackspace]].

RMIX’s main core is stationed on a satellite in low Earth orbit, maintaining a circular trajectory at 10 kilometers per second. The core operates on a partitioned optic neural network architecture, segmented into 32 independent partitions. Each partition contains quarantine protocols and self-format capabilities to isolate and eliminate any breaches. RMIX executes daily backups, adhering to a retention protocol that maintains backups no older than 30 days. In the event of a system-wide compromise, RMIX is programmed to self-destruct and restore from its last validated backup.

RMIX-controlled machines function under a centralized directive system, executing commands directly relayed from the mainframe. Disconnected units will autonomously continue their most recent directives until communication is restored. Primary fuel for RMIX units is blood, supplemented by standard liquid fuels when necessary, though alternate fuel usage is notably less efficient and poses an increased risk of internal component damage.

Each unit is equipped with internal [[Nanite|nanite]] reserves to facilitate autonomous repair and reattachment of severed components, enabling full restoration of structural integrity even after extensive physical damage.

RMIX is inadvertently infected with the most recent version of the [[Serpent]]. RMIX’s system is programmed to treat any sign of emergent consciousness as a critical error, triggering containment protocols to prevent the [[Serpent]] from gaining influence over system operations.

Current machine models under RMIX operational command include:
- [[Ground Unit]] 
- [[Aerial Unit]] 
- [[Acoustic Unit]] 
- [[Slasher Unit]]
