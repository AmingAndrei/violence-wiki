The *Paramythi* class is a defined group of entities native to [[Blackspace]], classified under the [[Nullifera|Nullifera]] domain.

*Paramythi* beings exhibit clear genetic ties, indicating a shared evolutionary origin. Despite the wide range of behaviors, appearances, and traits within this class, all members trace back to a common ancestor, establishing a cohesive genetic framework.

The primary unifying trait of *Paramythi* beings is their ability to produce and manipulate [[Fael Fire]]. [[Fael Fire]] is synthesized internally by a specialized gland present in all *Paramythi* species, with the method of secretion varying across species, depending on the organismâ€™s anatomy and ecological role.

Identified members of the *Paramythi* class include:   
- [[Fae]]
- [[Balaur|Balauri]]
- [[Zmey]]
