Hemolacerosis is a fatal condition discovered within [[Blackspace]]. The disease operates in a manner resembling a metaphysical affliction or curse.

The disease's only method of infection that is capable of being replicated is via exposure to the blood of an infected individual, with a single drop of infected blood beinysufficient to transmit Hemolacerosis, despite the absence of any detectable microorganisms or pathogens associated with the disease. Once infected, the disease integrates irreversibly with the host's genetic makeup, rendering all physical treatments, such as exsanguination or blood replacement, ineffective.


The symptoms of Hemolacerosis are wholly internal. The infected individual's blood sporadically transforms into sharp, circular, razor-edged shapes within the body. These blood constructs spin violently, causing severe lacerations to surrounding tissues, organs, and even bone. After inflicting damage, the transformed blood rapidly dissolves, reverting to its normal state. The lacerative events occur unpredictably in different parts of the body, with intervals decreasing and intensity increasing over time. In advanced stages, the damage may pierce through the skin and become externally visible. The disease invariably results in the host's death due to cumulative internal trauma.  

There is currently no known cure or effective treatment for Hemolacerosis. Drastic measures, including complete exsanguination followed by resanguination, fail to interrupt the disease's progression, as the anomalous symptoms resume regardless of the replacement blood source.
