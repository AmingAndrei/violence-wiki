Hexers are a rare and specialized subset of [[Echo|Echoes]]. 

During the initial formation of an [[Echo]], there is only a 1% chance that it will be coded with the ability to generate and use [[Vitiom]]. This ability grants the Hexer the capacity to compile and deploy [[Program|Programs]], similar to a [[Vesper]].

Due to their unique abilities, Hexers are tasked with combating [[Vesper|Vespers]] that pose a threat to [[Echo|Echoes]] or other beings. Given their proficiency with [[Vitiom]], they are the only [[Echo|Echoes]] capable of fighting [[Vesper|Vespers]] on equal terms. Hexers' abilities are vital in preventing widespread damage caused by rogue [[Vesper|Vespers]].

Information regarding active Hexers is intentionally suppressed, and their existence operates in relative secrecy. This suppression may serve to protect them from being specifically targeted by [[Vesper|Vespers]] or other hostile forces that would view them as a primary threat.
