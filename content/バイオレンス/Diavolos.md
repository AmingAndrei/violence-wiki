The *Diavolos* class, commonly referred to as "Devils," is a distinct taxonomic grouping within the [[Nullifera|Nullifera]] domain of [[Blackspace]]. This class is characterized by anomalous traits and evolutionary properties that defy conventional biological understanding within [[Realspace]] parameters.

The *Diavolos* class is notable for its lack of identifiable genetic history. Analysis reveals no ancestral lineage or genetic connections either between species within the class or with any known organisms. These entities frequently exhibit traits that are biologically impossible under [[Realspace]] conditions.  

This absence of genetic continuity underscores the class' anomalous nature, with members unified only by specific physiological and behavioral characteristics rather than shared evolutionary origins.

The unifying trait of all *Diavolos* species is their ability to enhance their physical and metaphysical power through fear. All members possess specialized organs capable of detecting and metabolizing cortisol and adrenaline secreted by nearby beings experiencing fear. This biochemical process amplifies their strength proportionally to the intensity and proximity of fear, including that of other *Diavolos*. The class thrives in fear-laden environments, leveraging this capability to dominate ecological niches or hostile interactions.

The following are identified species within the class:  
- [[Devil Catalyst|Devil Catalysts]]
- [[Devil Arm|Devil Arms]]
- [[Devil Strand|Devil Strands]]
- [[Nymph]]
- [[Void Whale]]
- [[Paracusia]]
