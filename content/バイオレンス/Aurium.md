Aurium is a substance synthesized by active [[Nanite|nanites]], appearing as a golden, viscous liquid. It is produced passively through the activities of [[Nanite|nanites]] and is stored in specialized storage modules within their structure. The production rate of Aurium is typically low.

Aurium serves a crucial role in the maintenance and repair of [[Nanite|nanites]]. It is utilized actively to heal both physical and code damage sustained by [[Nanite|nanites]]. In cases where a [[nanite]] depletes its stored Aurium, it loses its ability to heal until new Aurium is synthesized.
