The Zmey are a species of hexapodal, lizard-like organisms classified under the [[Paramythi]] class. 

Adult Zmey reach lengths of up to 30 meters. Their anatomy includes six legs, two wings, and a long tail and neck. They possess a dual skeletal system consisting of a robust endoskeleton and a metallic exoskeleton, which features small gaps that allow air circulation. In order to maintain this exoskeleton, Zmey regularly consume different inorganic metals and alloys, which are integrated into their exoskeleton. This exoskeleton is periodically shed during molting, enabling regeneration of damaged or lost body parts. Zmey have elongated necks, with horns growing in patterns unique to each individual. Exoskeleton shine is a  key indicator of individual health and fitness. Despite their reptilian appearance, Zmey are endothermic.

Each of their limbs is composed of detachable segments interconnected by a vascularized tissue layer. This design allows segments to separate without hemorrhaging, with nutrients and blood being passed through this tissue. Lost or damaged segments will regenerate during the next molting cycle.  

Zmey can expel a yellow [[Fael Fire]] up to a range of 10 meters. This is facilitated by a specialized sac located on the roof of their mouths. Their bodies secretes [[Fael Fire]] beneath their exoskeleton, which, upon contact with air, ignites, heating the exoskeleton from the inside and causing severe burns to any direct contact. If the exoskeleton is breached, [[Fael Fire]] will be violently expelled through the wound until the breach is sealed by molting.

Zmey reproduce sexually, with no significant sexual dimorphism. Fitness displays rely mainly on the reflective quality of the exoskeleton. Clutches typically contain four eggs, which are carefully incubated and protected by both parents in alternating shifts.
