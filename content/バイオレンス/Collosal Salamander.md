The Colossal Salamander is a [[Eukarya|re-evolved]] amphibian species of native to [[Blackspace]].

The Colossal Salamander can grow up to 15 meters in length, vastly surpassing the largest [[Realspace]] amphibians, such as the Chinese Giant Salamander (1.8 meters). ​While its underbelly remains white, the species exhibits the ability to display a range of colors across its skin. The species retains Axolotl-like external gills throughout its life, and, distinctly, possesses 10 limbs: two prominent front limbs and eight smaller legs.

Like all amphibians, the Collosal Salamander's ​​moist skin facilitates cutaneous respiration, with fully developed lungs enabling survival in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Their gills provide dual functionality, also aiding in respiration, along with acting as external digestive organs for filter feeding.

Collosal Salamanders are capable of metabolizing waterborne impurities, including oil, chemical pollutants, hazardous microorganisms, and even radioactive materials, with the use of their gills. They present absurd regenerative abilities surpassing those of Axolotls, enabling rapid recovery of lost or damaged tissues.
